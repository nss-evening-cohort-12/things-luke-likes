Here's a list of things I use/I'll be sharing with everyone over the next 6 months. All in one easy place for you to find.

## Software
* [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager I've been using for years. Different passwords for every login, one Master Password to keep it secure. Worth the price of admission
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Productivity app for MacOS. Replaces/supercharges Spolight search, adds clipboard history, and if you pay for the "Powerpack" you can make custom workflows
* [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=GYOlDkzD6Iw2I_pz&utm_source=customer_referral) - Not code related in the least, but getting my money under control lets me focus on the things that matter
* [Krisp](https://ref.krisp.ai/u/u1cd6a5070?utm_source=refprogram&utm_campaign=107156&locale=en-US) - Noise cancellation app. Hooks into zoom and makes it so the people/üê∂/üêà/whatever living with you don't have to be quiet while you're on a call. Plus if you email them and tell them you're a student, you'll get their Pro level free until September. Well worth it


## Hardware
* [Logitech MX Master 2s Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B071YZJ1G1?pldnSite=1) - We're gonna be remote for a while. Having a nice workstation is key, and this mouse is V Cool. Pricy, but has been worth it for me. There's a newer version out, which is probably great, but I don't have it so I can't say either way
* External Monitor - Honestly I just use whatever my work gives me/lets me take home. But having the extra space is going to be really helpful for everyone. I also have an app for my iPad that lets me use it as an external display (because my laptop is like 100 years old and can't do it natively)
* Fancy Keyboard - It's "a thing" in some circles of the Dev community. I built [this kit](https://cannonkeys.com/collections/frontpage/products/ortho60) with [these switches](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=851) and [these caps](https://kbdfans.com/products/big-bang-mda-profile-ortholinear-keycaps?_pos=3&_sid=6c398d79e&_ss=r). [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/) is a great, local-ish, resource if you wanna go nuts
* [Standing Desk](https://bit.ly/39MTHb1) - My Back Hurts
